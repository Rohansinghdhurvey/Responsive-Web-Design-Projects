	<h3>Introduction to Python</h3>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Welcome! This is your first step towards learning Python programming language. Or, Do you know this language already and are here just to revise your concepts?. It doesn't matter which category you belong to because we will be teaching you Python, right from the basics.</p>

<p>An experienced programmer might have an advantage of picking up topics and lessons rather quickly, even though we recommend you to not to hurry through the topics, since Python, although being a normal programming language, carries some nice treats for programmers, and you would not want to miss those in the tutorials.</p>

<p>For all the noobs out there, there is nothing to worry. You should be happy that you have chosen the most amazing and simple tutorial to learn Python.</p>

<div class="main-section" id="Features of Python">
	<h3>Features of Python</h3>
	<div class="content">
		<ul>
			<li>It has simple easy-to-use syntax.</li>
<li>It can run on almost any platform including Windows, Linux's all distros(All versions of Linux), Mac OS X, Unix etc.</li>
<li>You can even combine the pieces of other programming languages like C, C++, etc with python to utilize the best of both worlds.</li>
<li>It's large standard library support makes real life programming much easier.</li>
<li>Other than that, it's open source, and have a huge community support working actively with Python programming.</li>
<li>It's Object Oriented (also called OO Programming or OOP) which makes it more applicable to be used in real world application programming.</li>
<li>Also, it can not only be used to write complex programs but can also be used to design applications with GUI(Graphical User Interface).</li>

		</ul>

<div class="main-section" id="Applications of Python">
	<h3>Applications of Python</h3>
	<div class="conten">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Web Application:</b> Python can be used to develop scalable and secure web applications. Frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid etc are amazing to design and develop web based applications.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Computer Software or Desktop Applications:</b> As python can be used to develop GUI too, hence it is a great choice for developing desktop applications. Tk is an open source widget toolkit which can be used to develop desktop applications with python. Kivy is another such platform.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Scientific Computing Application:</b> For its amazing computational power and simple syntax, python is used for scientific computing applications. Python libraries like SciPy and NumPy are best suited for scientific computations.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>AI and ML(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning):</b> Python is at the fore front of the paradigm shift towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Image Processing:</b> Python is known for its image processing capabilities, which includes traversing and analysing any image pixel by pixel. There are numerous python libraries available for image processing, for example: Pillow, scikit-image etc.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="main-section" id="Python Syntax Rules">
	<h3>Python Syntax Rules</h3>
	<div class="conten">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Python is case sensitive.</b> Hence a variable with name yoyostudytonight is not same as yoYoStudytonight

			</li>
			<li>
<p><b>For path specification, </b>python uses forward slashes. Hence if you are working with a file, the default path for the file in case of Windows OS will have backward slashes, which you will have to convert to forward slashes to make them work in your python script.</p>
<p>For window's path C:\folderA\folderB relative python program path should be C:/folderA/folderB</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In python,<b> there is no command terminator</b>, which means no semicolon ; or anything.
So if you want to print something as output, all you have to do is:</p>
<p>print "Hello, World!"</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>In one line only a single executable statement should be written</b> and the line change act as command terminator in python.</p>
<p><b>To write two separate executable statements in a single line,</b> you should use a <b>semicolon ;</b> to separate the commands.</p> <p>For example,

print "Hello, World!" ; print "This is second line"</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In python, you can use single quotes '', double quotes "" and even triple quotes ''' """ to represent string literals.</p>
		<p>	word = 'word'<br>
			sentence = "This is a one line sentence."<br>
			para =  """This is a paragraph <br>
			which has multiple lines""" </p></li>

<li><p>In python, you can write <b>comments</b> in your program using a # at the start. A comment is ignored while the python script is executed.</p>
<p># this is a comment<br>
print "Hello, World!"<br>
# this is a <br>
# multiline comment</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

</div>
<div class="main-section" id="Hello World Program">
	<h3>Hello World Program</h3>
	<div class="content">
		<p>it's just one single line, nothing above it, nothing below it. To print Hello, World! on screen</p>

		<p>print "Hello, World!"</p>
	</div>Hello World ProgramHello World Program
</div>
<div class="main-section">
	<h3>Variables</h3>
	<div class="conten">
		<p>variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The variable name can consist of alphabet(s), number(s) and underscore(s) only.</li>
<li>The first character in variable's name cannot be a number. Hence i-am-variable, variable!, 1variable, #variable, are all invalid variable names. While i_am_variable, variable, variable1, _variable, are all valid names.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="main-section" id="Data Types in Python">
	<h3>Data Types in Python</h3>
	<div class="content">
		<p>As the name itself suggests, these are some different types of data that the python compiler understands. Just like the Computer can understand only binary numbers (i.e., 1 and 0), so that is the one and only data type that a Computer can understand but python has more. As far as Python, programmers are provided with various ways of representing data - like your name, roll number, marks, to the height of Mt. Everest, world population etc. Basically, anything that holds some raw information.</p>
		<P>Data in Python can be one of the following 5 types:</P>
		<ol>
			<li>Numbers</li>
<li>None</li>
<li>Sequences</li>
<li>Sets</li>
<li>Mappings</li>
		</ol>

<div class="main-section" id="If Else Statements">
	<h3> If Else Statements</h3>
	<div class="conten">
	<p><b>If</b><br>
		if keyword and the conditional expression is ended with a colon. In [conditional expression] some conditional expression is introduced that is supposed to return a boolean value, i.e., True or False. If the resulting value is True then the [statement to execute] is executed, which is mentioned below the if condition with a tabspace(This indentation is very important).
	</p>
	<p> Exa.<br>
		if [conditional expression]:
		<br>
	<span class="if">[statement(s) to execute]</span>
	</p>
	<p><b>Else</b><br>
		An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
	</p>
	<p> Exa.<br>
		if[conditional expression]:
		<br></p>
<p><span class="if">[statement to execute]</span></p>

<div class="main-section" id="Loops in Python">
	<h3> Loops in Python</h3>
	<div class="conten">
	<p><b>For</b><br>
		The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
	</p>
	<p><b>Syntax of for Loop</b><br>
<p>for val in sequence:</p>
	<span class="if">Body of for</span>
	</p>
	<p><b>While</b><br>
		The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
	</p>
	<p><b>Syntax of While Loop</b><br>
		while test_expression:
		<br></p>
<p><span class="if">Body for while</span></p>
